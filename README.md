## Delete Temp Files
`delete-temp-files` provides a simple utility script for cleaning temp files on Windows. It consists of two scripts - `delete-temp-files.ps1` and `run.bat`.
- `delete-temp-files.ps1` is the main script. It gets the environment variable for temp file location and then proceeds to try to delete the files and folders in the temp directory.
- `run.bat` is the "run script" which triggers the main script.
